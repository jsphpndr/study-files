    Pleasant, this is basically the same thing you handed in before WITH the SAME errors 
    and it's still not the assignment AFTER you sat through me presenting the structure 
    of a post IN CLASS.

    What gone down, man? NOT ONE MISTAKE CORRECTED?

    I will have to mark it as it's presented now.

    Indentation: -1pt
    No <h1>: -1pt
    Broken Code: -1pt
    Head Element: -2pts
    Not the Assignment: 1pt

    9/15

    60%

    Pleasant, I'm really disappointed considering that I gave you an opportunity to correct
    this.
